# Using the Data Layer Repository

This repository hosts primarily collections data, datasets and data extraction/transformation scripts, and the [CaD@Pitt Data Dictionary](https://github.com/CaDatPitt/data-layers/wiki).

## Directories
This repository comprises the following directories:
* **base-layers**: curated datasets derived from library metadata records
* **extension-layers**: datasets that extend/enrich base layers
* **source-data**: snapshots of library metadata records
<!--* **processing-tools**: scripts for extracting and transforming data from library metadata records-->

The “base-layers,” “extension-layers” and “source-data” directories each contain subdirectories, organized by collection. Subdirectories under “source-data” contain third-level directories, organized by metadata schema. Subdirectories under “extension-layers” contain third-level  directories organized by project.

## Data Dictionary
The [CaD@Pitt Data Dictionary](http://cadatpitt.github.io/documentation/04-data-dictionary) defines and describes the data layers in this repository, including the project’s related controlled vocabularies and encoding schemes, metadata element sets, and application profiles.
